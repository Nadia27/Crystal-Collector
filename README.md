# Crystal Collector Game

A fun and interactive game for web browsers. With this app I used the jQuery library to dynamically update HTML pages.

## Built With

+ jQuery
+ HTML
+ CSS
+ Bootstrap

### How to Play

There will be four crystals displayed as buttons on the page.

The player will be shown a random number at the the start of the game.
When the player clicks on a crystal, it will add a specific amount of points to the player's total score.
The amount of each crystal will be hidden until player clicks a crystal.
Your score will be update on your score counter.
The player wins if their total score matches the random number from the beginning of the game.
The player loses if their score goes above the random number.
